# Comprehensive Report on Contract Clause Analysis

## 1. Creditcards.com, Inc.
- **Section:** 20. Warranty Disclaimer
- **Content:** "Chase makes no warranties, representations or conditions with regard to the Chase Affiliate Program or any services provided hereunder, whether express or implied, arising by law or otherwise, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE."
- **Source:** CREDITCARDS.COM, INC., S-1, 8/10/2007
- **Analysis:**
    - This clause highlights the lack of any expressed or implied warranties from Chase regarding the services provided. 
    - Key implications include the explicit denial of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which poses a risk to the consumer.
    - The clause reinforces that any claims related to performance or service expectations are effectively null and void.

## 2. Digital Cinema Destinations Corp.
- **Section:** Section 9.2 Disclaimers
- **Content:** "EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AND EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 9.1(c), ANY AND ALL INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE NCM PROPERTY, IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'WITH ALL FAULTS' AND NCM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NCM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE."
- **Source:** DIGITAL CINEMA DESTINATIONS CORP., S-1, 12/20/2011
- **Analysis:**
    - This section imposes a stringent limitation on liability by asserting that the company provides its products and services 'as is,' limiting any recourse the consumer has for defects or dissatisfaction.
    - The warranty disclaimers mirrored those in the Creditcards.com clause, reinforcing the unavailability of any implied warranties, including fitness for purpose and non-infringement.
    - The mention of services being potentially interrupted or having errors creates a substantial risk to consumers relying on expected service performance.

## Comparative Analysis
### Similarities
- Both clauses categorically disclaim any implied warranties, establishing a low threshold of accountability for the respective companies.
- The language utilized in both sections conveys a similar legal approach, focusing on the "as is" provision and the emphasis on no representations regarding quality or service reliability.

### Differences
- Creditcards.com explicitly refers to the Chase Affiliate Program and explicitly mentions implied warranties related to trade performance, whereas Digital Cinema Destinations Corp. takes a broader perspective by covering its entire range of services and properties.
- Digital Cinema Destinations Corp. adds an explicit note about the potential for service interruptions, detailing a risk aspect potentially less emphasized in the Creditcards.com clause.

## Conclusion
The findings from the contract clause analyses reveal substantial disclaimers of liability in both agreements, albeit with minor variations in the scope of reference and specificity regarding service performance and reliability. Stakeholders should be aware of these disclaimers as they significantly impact their rights and recourse options under the contracts reviewed.
